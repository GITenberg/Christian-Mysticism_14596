description: First delivered as a series of eight lectures at Oxford University, this
  1899 volume in defense of the Christian faith, "to confute all heretics and schismatics,"
  is based on nature and reason rather than signs and wonders. Mysticism is defined
  here as the realization--both mental and physical--of the presence of God. Included
  here are chapters, "The Mystical Element in the Bible," "Practical and Devotional
  Mysticism," "Nature-Mysticism and Symbolism," and more.
